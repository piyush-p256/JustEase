# JustEase

India's decentralized legal system and complex paperwork make it difficult for individuals, small businesses, as well as lawyers. Every year, more than 60-70K lawyers graduate, and the rate keeps increasing year by year, surpassing the available positions in law firms, out of which only 10% make a sustainable living. The remaining tend to seek alternative employment. This imbalance creates a lack of legal aid and advice, especially for unreserved portions of the population that are in urgent need, while also exaggerating the inefficiencies in the Indian Judiciary. Moreover, forming a cycle of delayed justice compounded by high costs and limited accessibility discourages individuals and small businesses from seeking legal remedies.
